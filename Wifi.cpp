      //------------ General idea -------------//
      /*
      If there are more access points than houses, the problem is trivial

      If not, we are going to do a dichotomy over the possible min distance (starting with min distance = size of the whole stree).
      For each distance d, we will then try to place the access points such that no house is farer that d from any points.
      To do that we will proceed as follow (gluton) :
      - Start at the first house
      - Go down the street
      - If you go beyond d from the first house, place an access point
      - Go to the next house
      - Repeat until the end of the stret or going out of access points
